    The NZ Primary School Fonts are an English language, OpenType, variable typeface family designed specifically to meet New Zealand Education standards. While weights, widths and optical sizes were carefully crafted to work well in an New Zealand classroom environment, they are just as comfortable to read and work with in the home environment.
